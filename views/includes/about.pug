    p.
      I was born in the Las Vegas area, surrounded by casinos, gambling, and
      technology. Despite my parents exposing me to computers at a young age, it
      wasn't until I was about 14 that I had done any programming. Once I tried it
      I immediately fell in love with it. Now, I write code both as a career
      and as a hobby.

      Currently, I work in Downtown Las Vegas as a Software Engineer for Sports
      Challenge Network (previously Rolltech Inc). I write and maintain our
      front-end, back-end, and mobile code. Our products all revolve around the
      sport of bowling and people who bowl competitively. Following are a few of my
      skills.
