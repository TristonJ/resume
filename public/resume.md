- 2015-Present, Software Engineer, Rolltech Inc.

- I started out as an intern working entirely on Rolltech’s Android application, and quickly moved to a full-time

- position building an entirely new skill-based gaming platform.

- ●

Fixed almost all of the most reported Android bugs and parity issues in a matter of two weeks, thenmoved on to rework much of the app’s code in an effort to help avoid future technical debt.

- ● Built the Node.js API for a skill-based gaming platform called Action Bowling that now generates

over 90% of Rolltech’s revenue.

- ● Currently, I am the main contributor to Action Bowling, which includes the Node.js API and the

front-end Handlebars and Javascript. I am also the sole contributor to the Android application.- 2014, Software Engineer, Congressional App Challenge

- I competed with a small four-person team in the first generation of the Congressional App Challenge, where

- ● Was the only developer of an Android application meant to teach children the basic physics of a

acceleration, speed, etc. I then rendered the results using OpenGL.
